        </h3>
        <h3>Basic info</h3>
        <p>My name is Gergely Izs√°k, my friends call me Gera. I was born in Slovakia, but my mother language is
            Hungarian, so I prefer to call myself a Hungarian. Thanks to my father I experienced the world of computers
            as soon as they were available in public and I can say that I fell in love with them for the first sight.
            Computers were my main jam when I was a teenager and this interest started to slowly fade away as soon as I
            grew older. But when I came to Vienna in 2018 and started to learn Web Development from 2020 it all started
            over and I found myself quickly back in this world again.</p>

            alt="Portre">
        <h3>Studies</h3>
        <p>My Web Developer carrier started in Slovakia, where I was learning Informatics in middle school and I created
            a simple page web site for my Matura work. But there was a twist: we never learned anything about that in
            school, so I had to find out for myself. That time computers were really big and heavy, all the
            informatics stuff just started to begin their journey in this World. As soon as Covid started, I realized
            that I have the time and courage to level up my skills and learn something new, useful and that is how I
            started with Frontend Developement. From 2020 I am a self lerner, so I used pretty much all the available,
            useful and the best websites to learn my profession. This includes: <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>, <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a>, <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> and a
            few mobile apps like: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sololearn.com/home">SoloLearn</a> and <a
                target="_blank" href="https://programminghub.io/">ProgrammingHub</a>. After a while I found these
            awesome bootcamps like
            <a target="_blank" href="https://codeberryschool.com/hu">CodeBerry</a> and <a target="_blank"
                href="https://codefactory.wien/en/home-en/">CodeFactory</a>, where I studied Frontend Developement
            succesfully and now I can not stop myself from learning and achieving more.
        </p>
        <h3>Knowledge</h3>
        <p>As I am just at the beginning of my journey, with lots of work and learning hours, I started to build useful
            and exciting knowledge in the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>SASS/SCSS</li>
            <li>Bootstrap</li>
            <li>TypeScript</li>
            <li>Json</li>
            <li>Angular</li>
            <li>Git and GitHub</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the future I would like to sharpen my Frontend Developement skills and even learn to work with the design part of the web page. I am learning continuously to work better with all these languages and programs and I do have the passion for
            it, because I love new technologies and to code. I can imagine myself evolving in this area to an
            unimaginary level, because that is what I enjoy the most in my life: To get better and better and NEVER give
            up!
