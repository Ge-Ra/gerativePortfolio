        <h1 class="text-center mt-5">My Hobbies</h1>
        <h3 class="text-center m-3">I will show you here most of my hobbies</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">This list includes mainly skill toys and that is because I want to show you how much attention,
            practice and
            endurance these little things needs to master them. I always had interest of learning something new,
            unusual, unique and that is how I started to develop my fine motor skills which are really welcomed in this
            area. I learned so much from these small toys, they teached me to NEVER give up on anything, to always move
            forward and that I can achieve whatever I want with practice. <br>A skill toy is an object or theatrical
            prop used for dexterity play or an object manipulation performance. A skill toy can be any static or
            inanimate object with which a person dances, manipulates, spins, tosses, or simply plays. Most
            skill toys are played alone, although some can be played with multiple people.</p>

        <h3 class="my-3">Yo-yo</h3>
        <div class="pb-5 d-flex flex-column">
            <p>This is where all started to me. In 2011 I picked up my first modern yoyo, which became my all time
                favourite skill toy. I learned all the basic tricks and than I started to compete with these. All the contests where I competed ended up with reaching the long avaited gold medal.</p>

        <h3 class="my-3">Kendama</h3>
        <div class="pb-5 d-flex flex-column">
            <p>Kendama became my passion, because suddenly the skin on my hand got ill and I could not yoyo more. I
                needed another skill toy in which I will not irritate my skin too much. That is how this awesome wooden
                skill toy came into my life. In the past I had two different sponsors who trusted in me, so I could
                advertise their products with very well. Once when I was in Romania I had the opprotunity to work with
                kids and show, teach, perform them kendama the whole time.</p>

        <h3 class="my-3">Begleri</h3>
        <div class="pb-5 d-flex flex-column">
            <p>Begleri is the smallest and the most versatile skill toy I ever tried and got good at it. From 2016 till
                now I am a proud, sponsored, pro player for <a href="https://www.aroundsquare.com/">Aroundsquare</a>, a
                company lead with my friend Matthew, located in Canada. This is the skilltoy what changed the game for
                me for ever. I can carry one with me anywhere and I can play with it anytime I want. I even developed my
                own tricks with it, which you can find <a

        <h3 class="my-3">Knucklebone</h3>
        <div class="pb-5 d-flex flex-column">
            <p>Aroundsquare’s Knucklebone is the original hardbody knuckle roller. It is a skill toy that is manipulated
                with the fingers to perform tricks and patterns, or simply to pass the time. It is very discrete (unless dropped) and can be played in restricted spaces. The kbone makes a great EDC item, and serves well as a worry stone. But don’t be deceived. In the right hands, this toy is capable of complex technical tricks that can entertain for hours.</p>

        <div class="pb-5 d-flex flex-column">
            <p>Juggling is really fun and it is easy to learn, you just need a litle bit of concentration and calm in
                your mind and that is why I love it. You can get really creative with it and develope your own style.
                And if you are bored, just toss one more ball to the remaining and try to play like that.</p>
